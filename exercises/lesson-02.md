# Lesson 02 exercises
## Docker

## Exercise 01-1
### Install Docker
## macOS 
Installing Docker on a macOS system should straightforward, just follow https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/ and you should be up and running in no time.

## Linux
Running Linux? Then you are a bit on your own. Check out https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ and find the instructions for your distribution.

## Windows
If you are running Windows, we recommend using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Check out the guide @ https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/ for more information. Select one of the Debian-based distributions (we recommend Ubuntu).

If you are running a Home edition of Windows 10/11, check out https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-desktop-for-windows-home-is-here/ on how to get up and running.


> :warning: **Be sure to download and install WSL 2** If you are curious about the differnce, check out https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/compare-versions
